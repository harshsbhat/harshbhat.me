---

During the hacktoberfest I was contributing to a lot of open source projects. That's when I discovered this CRM called Twenty. It is supposed to be an open-source alternative for Salesforce.

## Why TwentyCRM is better?

I have used a fair number of open-source projects. A lot of them come at the cost of good UI, some key features, and overall projects being well polished. But recently, a lot of projects are trying to break that stereotype. TwentyCRM being one of them with GREAT discord support, pleasing UI, and more than neccessary features.

Let's quickly go through some of those features.

### Great UI:

As I mentioned earlier, There used to be a stereotype that most of the UIs of open-source tools are decent or not so clean. But start-ups like Cal.com, Twenty, and Unkey are determined to break these stereotypes. They make great products with great UI. TwentyCRM is one of them. It is open-source but with great UI that really makes your work feel like fun.

### Customizable Workflows:

It's important for CRM's to adapt workflows  that can match the need of the businesses. TwentyCRM's Customizable workflows plays a big part in these scenarios.

### Integration & Automation:

Twenty CRM integrates easily with tools like Zapier for no-code automation, as well as custom integrations via REST and GraphQL APIs, which makes automating workflows a breeze.

### Comprehensive Data Management:

The platform supports custom data models, list and Kanban views, advanced search, and detailed note-taking, making data organization and retrieval smooth and efficient.

### Open-Source Flexibility:

What if you need more flexibility than this? Well it is open source. You can just self-host and make those changes for your own version. 

## Why Businesses Should Consider Twenty CRM:

With the ability to self-host, integrate across tech stacks, and avoid high subscription fees, Twenty CRM is ideal for developers and small to medium-sized businesses looking for a cost-effective and flexible CRM solution. You can truly own your CRM, adapt it as you like, and contribute to the project alongside an active community.
