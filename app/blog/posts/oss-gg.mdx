---

Hey, some of you that actually read my posts might know that I was participating in a month-long hackathon called oss.gg. It is basically a gamified version of Hacktoberfest.

In simple terms, you contribute with either code, articles, videos, feedback, design, or social media posts; depending on your quality of contributions, you get points from 50 to 1500. Each point is basically a ticket for a raffle with exciting prizes like Mac, iPhone, PS5, and much more.

So in this article, I will tell you guys my experience throughout this hackathon.

## How it started:

I frequently contribute to [unkey](https://unkey.com) one of the participating companies in this hackathon. That's when I saw the test bug opened on their repo.

[https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/issues/2132](https://github.com/unkeyed/unkey/issues/2132). Me being me. I started researching more into what oss.gg. That's when I discovered about this gamified version of Hacktoberfest.

I knew my favourite repo was participating. So I had to participate too!

## How it is going:

Unkey had a few open issues I was working on already. I quickly knocked my first few contributions. Just after couple of days into October I was already ranked #1. That's when I also wrote an fairly decent sized API route for Unkey which gave me around 300 points. It was a massive confidence boost for me.

But then I realised that there are SIX more repos participating in this hackathon. It is fairly hard to setup an entirely new codebase and make significant code contributions for them. So I decided to go ahead with non-code contributions for other repos and code conntributions for Unkey.

That strategy worked like a charm. I was #1 even after 20 days of October.
