For context, let's quickly understand the meaning of DDoS attacks. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks typically involve overwhelming a service with a high load of requests, making the service inaccessible to legitimate users.

Kind of like this:

How can rate limiting play a role in DDoS protection? It’s fairly simple. What if these malicious requests never reach the server at all?

For instance, if you set a rate limit on one of your routes using a unique identifier like the IP address or API key, these limits should ideally be enforced before any heavy computations in your service take place.

By setting the right rate limits, the chances of your service getting DDoSed are much lower compared to routes without any rate limiting in place.

If the requests don’t reach the heavy/expensive computations, the chances of your services going down or you getting a big bill are significantly lower.

With services like [Unkey](https://app.unkey.com/), it’s much easier to implement standalone rate limits for your services. It literally takes just a few lines of code:

```javascript
const { success } = await unkey.limit("my-user-id")
if (!success){
  // reject request
}
// handle request
```

That's it. 

**Conclusion**:

To conclude, rate limiting prevents malicious requests from reaching the expensive computations, saving you from downtime and potentially saving you money too!
