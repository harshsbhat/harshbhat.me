## Why Twenty CRM?

Majority of the companies need some sort of CRM that they can use to manage their customers and sales in a better way. The problem, though, is most of them are unaffordable for newer or smaller businesses. Solution? Open source service like Twenty CRM that can be self-hosted at a very fair price.

In this article, we will walkthrough how you can self-host something like Twenty CRM for your company. Let's start.

###  1. Integrating Messaging & Calendar Sync

To start messaging and calendar features we will need to setup recurring jobs in the worker container.

```bash
yarn command:prod cron:messaging:messages-import
yarn command:prod cron:messaging:message-list-fetch
yarn command:prod cron:calendar:calendar-event-list-fetch
```

These commands will import and sync your gmail and calendar data automatically. With Twenty, you’ll have all your messages and events in one place!

### 2. Setting Up Environment Variables

Now, let's quickly setup all the environment variables. We are covering all the essential variables here for both frontend and backend.

**Frontend Variables:**

```plaintext
REACT_APP_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000	# URL for backend server
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false	# Generate source maps for debugging
CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN		# You will need to take this token from chromatic.
```

**Backend Variables:**

```plaintext
PG_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pw@localhost:5432/db	# Database connection
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379	# Redis connection URL
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000	# URL to the backend server
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<random>	# Secret key for access tokens
CACHE_STORAGE_TTL=3600 * 24 * 7	#Cache Time-to-Live in second
```

**Secure Token Generation:**

We will need to generate some unique tokens for a few variables my personal favourite way is to use openssl. But you can use any other way to generate these tokens.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

We will need these tokens in the following variables.

```plaintext
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=first_random_string
LOGIN_TOKEN_SECRET=second_random_string
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=third_random_string
FILE_TOKEN_SECRET=fourth_random_string
```

**Configuring Email & Storage:**

Now, let's enable email notifications and file storage. 

If you are using Gmail you can go ahead with this.

```plaintext
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=465
EMAIL_SMTP_USER=gmail_email_address
EMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD=gmail_app_password
```
For local storage:

```plaintext
STORAGE_TYPE=local
STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH=.local-storage
```

Alternatively you can also use S3 storage:

```plaintext
STORAGE_S3_REGION=us-east-1
STORAGE_S3_NAME=my-bucket
STORAGE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=my-access-key
STORAGE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=my-secret-key
```

**Launch Twenty with Docker Compose:**

With environment variables set up let's spin up the container and get started.

```bash
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/main/packages/twenty-docker/.env.example
```
Now, download the docker-compose.yml file:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twentyhq/twenty/main/packages/twenty-docker/docker-compose.yml
```

Start the App

Run this command to launch Twenty in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You can now access Twenty at http://localhost:3000. If you need external access, update SERVER_URL in the .env file, and then restart the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

**Configuring for External Access:**

Just change the `SERVER_URL` to your domain or ip to make this available over the internet.

Direct Access (No Reverse Proxy):

```bash
SERVER_URL=http://your-domain-or-ip:3000
```

With Reverse Proxy (Standard Ports):

```bash
SERVER_URL=https://your-domain-or-ip
```

Restart your docker container after changing these variables.

**Common problems:**

1. Login Issues:
If you’re having trouble logging in, reset the database:

```bash
docker exec -it twenty-server-1 npx nx database:reset
```

Then restart your containers:

```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

2. Reverse Proxy Problems:

While using the reverse proxy make sure that `SERVER_URL` matches the access url, and check your reverse proxy settings to make sure headers like X-Forwarded-For are correctly set.

**Advanced Options: Integrate AI and Telemetry:**

You can also enable AI based tools and features:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

If you’re using Sentry for error logging, update these variables:


```bash
SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@xxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxx
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```
