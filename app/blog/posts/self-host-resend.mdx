Today, we are going to talk about an open-source alternative for email-sending services that can literally save you from a big monthly bill.

We all know sending emails directly with SES can be a headache. There should be a simpler alternative for that. However, subscribing to a SaaS model, especially when you have a large audience, can become quite expensive. That’s why having a self-hostable option for these services is crucial.

That’s where service like [Unsend](https://unsend.dev/) comes in. Why Unsend? It’s fairly easy to self-host and uses SES on the backend, which is likely the most affordable option available right now.

It also offers a great UI, unlike many other open-source alternatives that often compromise on user experience to cut costs.

By the way, this is not sponsored—it’s something I have used and contributed to multiple times.

Unsend also offers a custom SMTP platform that can be integrated with providers like Supabase, NextAuth, and others.

Kind of like this:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: "smtp.unsend.dev",
  port: 465,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: "unsend",
    pass: "us_123",
  },
  tls: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false,
  },
});
```
